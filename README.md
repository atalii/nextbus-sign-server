# Nextbus Sign Server

This repo will be a reimplementation of the server used to control NextBus
railway platform signs based on some reverse engineering of the software
running on the SBCs. For more reveng info, see [this repository.](https://github.com/tuckertwo/led-matrix-platform-signs).

We aim to implement and handle all the messages exposed and maybe provide a
nice UI to control a sign or two.
